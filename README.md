# medical-drugs-reviews

My aim with this project was to create a dashboard that summarises user reviews on meamedica.com. Moreover, I also wanted users to be able to be able to see reviews of people similar to them, thus the graphs and tables are interactive to filter by gender, medicine, age range and disease.
The main focus was on secondary effects of medicine and how to stop them in written reviews.

These are all the notebooks I used to create my voila app.

Thesis 1 Webcrapping: in order to get the dataset to analyse it, we needed to extract it from the source webite
Thesis 2 Text Mining: search for occurrences of strings of words relating to secondary effects in order to spot secondary effects
Thesis 3 Graphs: testing the data by creating graphs and tables to see what we can deduce from our dataset
Thesis 4 Voila: the final results with interactive graphs and tables
